Hi Wojciech,

I figure you're a hard person to get hold of so I'm hoping this will get your attention.

Optimal is a team of engineers and scientists from Oxford, MIT and DeepMind, on a mission to grow safer,
healthier food by deploying fully autonomous indoor farms outside every city on earth. 
We are backed by world-leading VC funds, including Founders Fund, who have backed companies such as SpaceX, Palantir and Square.

We are bringing in a Lead software engineer to take full ownership of the design, development and deployment of key parts
of our autonomous greenhouse control system. I think you could be just who we are looking for.
You would work within a multidisciplinary team across software engineering, control and reinforcement learning to automate growing
within our large-scale, $50m pilot facilities.

If you're interested, I'd love to arrange an introductory call with our Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davephunter/"> David </a> 
to discuss more details.



All the best,
Stevan
